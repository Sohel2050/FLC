# Stockfish Puzzle Integration Requirements

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for integrating Stockfish engine into the existing chess puzzles feature. The integration will enable dynamic solution calculation and validation, making the puzzle system more scalable and robust by leveraging the chess engine's analytical capabilities instead of relying solely on pre-defined solutions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Stockfish Integration for Puzzle Validation

**User Story:** As a chess player, I want the puzzle system to use a chess engine for move validation, so that I can be confident that the solutions are accurate and comprehensive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a puzzle is loaded THEN the system SHALL initialize Stockfish engine for that puzzle position
2. WHEN a user makes a move in a puzzle THEN the system SHALL use Stockfish to validate if the move leads to the puzzle objective
3. WHEN validating moves THEN the system SHALL consider multiple correct solutions, not just pre-defined ones
4. IF Stockfish is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fallback to the existing pre-defined solution validation
5. WHEN using Stockfish validation THEN the system SHALL maintain the same user experience as the current implementation

### Requirement 2: Engine-Verified Solution Validation

**User Story:** As a chess player, I want the puzzle system to use engine analysis to verify the single best solution, so that I learn the most accurate and optimal moves.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a puzzle is loaded THEN the system SHALL use the single best solution path as determined by engine analysis
2. WHEN validating moves THEN the system SHALL only accept moves that follow the optimal solution sequence
3. WHEN a puzzle has a cached solution THEN the system SHALL use that solution without running the engine
4. IF no cached solution exists THEN the system SHALL use Stockfish to find the single best solution and cache it
5. WHEN the engine finds a better solution than pre-defined THEN the system SHALL update the cached solution

### Requirement 3: Enhanced Hint System with Engine Analysis

**User Story:** As a chess player, I want hints that are generated by the chess engine, so that I receive more accurate and contextual guidance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests a hint THEN the system SHALL use Stockfish to find the best move in the current position
2. WHEN providing hints THEN the system SHALL offer both engine-generated and pre-defined hints
3. WHEN Stockfish suggests a move THEN the system SHALL provide a human-readable explanation of why it's good
4. IF the user is on the wrong track THEN the system SHALL use engine analysis to guide them back to the solution
5. WHEN multiple good moves exist THEN the hint system SHALL prioritize moves that lead to the puzzle objective

### Requirement 4: Puzzle Difficulty Assessment

**User Story:** As a chess player, I want puzzles to be accurately rated based on engine analysis, so that I can practice at the appropriate difficulty level.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading puzzles THEN the system SHALL use Stockfish to verify the puzzle difficulty rating
2. WHEN a puzzle has multiple solutions THEN the system SHALL rate difficulty based on the easiest solution path
3. WHEN engine analysis contradicts the stored difficulty THEN the system SHALL log the discrepancy for review
4. IF a puzzle position is invalid or unsolvable THEN the system SHALL mark it as corrupted and skip it
5. WHEN displaying difficulty levels THEN the system SHALL show engine-verified puzzle counts

### Requirement 5: Performance Optimization for Engine Usage

**User Story:** As a chess player, I want the puzzle system to respond quickly, so that engine integration doesn't slow down my practice sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing Stockfish for puzzles THEN the system SHALL use optimized engine settings for quick analysis
2. WHEN validating moves THEN the engine analysis SHALL complete within 500ms for most positions
3. WHEN the engine is analyzing THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading indicators
4. IF engine analysis takes too long THEN the system SHALL timeout and fallback to pre-defined solutions
5. WHEN switching between puzzles THEN the system SHALL reuse the same engine instance for efficiency

### Requirement 6: Fallback and Error Handling

**User Story:** As a chess player, I want the puzzle system to work reliably even if the chess engine encounters issues, so that my practice sessions are not interrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Stockfish fails to initialize THEN the system SHALL fallback to pre-defined solution validation
2. WHEN engine analysis fails THEN the system SHALL use cached results or pre-defined solutions
3. WHEN engine gives unexpected results THEN the system SHALL log the issue and use fallback validation
4. IF engine crashes during analysis THEN the system SHALL restart it automatically and continue
5. WHEN fallback mode is active THEN the system SHALL inform the user that engine features are unavailable

### Requirement 7: Engine Configuration for Puzzles

**User Story:** As a chess player, I want the engine to be optimized for puzzle solving, so that it provides accurate and fast analysis appropriate for tactical problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring Stockfish for puzzles THEN the system SHALL set appropriate depth and time limits
2. WHEN analyzing puzzle positions THEN the engine SHALL use settings optimized for tactical analysis
3. WHEN evaluating positions THEN the system SHALL configure engine to prioritize finding forced sequences
4. IF puzzle requires deep calculation THEN the system SHALL allow longer analysis time for complex positions
5. WHEN engine settings are applied THEN the system SHALL ensure they don't conflict with regular game usage

### Requirement 8: Integration with Existing Puzzle System

**User Story:** As a chess player, I want the engine integration to enhance the existing puzzle system without breaking current functionality, so that I can continue using puzzles seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN engine integration is active THEN all existing puzzle features SHALL continue to work as before
2. WHEN loading existing puzzle data THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with current JSON format
3. WHEN saving puzzle progress THEN the system SHALL use the same storage mechanism as before
4. IF engine validation differs from pre-defined solutions THEN the system SHALL prefer engine results but log discrepancies
5. WHEN users interact with puzzles THEN the UI SHALL remain unchanged except for enhanced feedback
