# Task 1: Fix PlayScreen Native Ad Loading Issue - Implementation Summary

## Problem Identified
The PlayScreen native ads were not loading immediately when the app started, even though PlayScreen was the default selected tab (index 0). The issue was in the visibility tracking logic and ad loading state management.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Initial Visibility**: PlayScreen receives `isVisible: true` on app startup since `_selectedTab = 0`
2. **State Management**: The `_hasLoadedAd` flag was set but not properly used to prevent duplicate loading
3. **Error Handling**: Limited error handling and no proper flag reset on failures
4. **Race Conditions**: No protection against multiple simultaneous ad load requests
5. **Memory Management**: Ad disposal was basic without proper state cleanup

## Implementation Changes

### 1. Enhanced State Management
- **Added `_isLoadingAd` flag**: Prevents multiple simultaneous ad load requests
- **Improved `_hasLoadedAd` usage**: Properly tracks successful ad loads
- **Better flag coordination**: Ensures flags are properly reset on errors and disposal

### 2. Fixed Initial Loading Logic
```dart
@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  debugPrint('PlayScreen: initState called, isVisible: ${widget.isVisible}');
  // Load ad immediately if screen is initially visible (default tab)
  if (widget.isVisible) {
    debugPrint('PlayScreen: Loading ad on initState');
    _createNativeAd();
  }
}
```

### 3. Improved Visibility Change Handling
```dart
@override
void didUpdateWidget(PlayScreen oldWidget) {
  super.didUpdateWidget(oldWidget);
  // Load ad when screen becomes visible and hasn't loaded yet
  if (widget.isVisible && !oldWidget.isVisible && !_hasLoadedAd && !_isLoadingAd) {
    debugPrint('PlayScreen: Loading ad on visibility change');
    _createNativeAd();
  }
  // Dispose ad when screen becomes invisible to free memory
  else if (!widget.isVisible && oldWidget.isVisible) {
    debugPrint('PlayScreen: Disposing ad on visibility change');
    _disposeNativeAd();
  }
}
```

### 4. Enhanced Ad Creation Logic
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Check `_isLoadingAd` and existing ad before creating new one
- **Better Error Handling**: Proper flag reset on load failures
- **Mounted Checks**: Prevent setState calls on disposed widgets
- **Debug Logging**: Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting

### 5. Improved Error Handling
```dart
onAdFailedToLoad: (ad, error) {
  debugPrint('PlayScreen: Native ad failed to load: $error');
  ad.dispose();
  _isLoadingAd = false;
  _hasLoadedAd = false;
  if (mounted) {
    setState(() {
      isAdLoaded = false;
    });
  }
  // Don't retry immediately to avoid infinite loops
},
```

### 6. Enhanced UI Feedback
- **Loading Indicator**: Shows loading state while ad is being fetched
- **Graceful Fallback**: UI remains functional even if ads fail to load
- **Proper Constraints**: Fixed height containers prevent layout shifts

### 7. Memory Management Improvements
```dart
void _disposeNativeAd() {
  debugPrint('PlayScreen: Disposing native ad');
  _nativeAd?.dispose();
  _nativeAd = null;
  _hasLoadedAd = false; // Reset flag so ad can load again when screen becomes visible
  _isLoadingAd = false; // Reset loading flag
  if (mounted) {
    setState(() {
      isAdLoaded = false;
    });
  }
}
```

## Key Features Implemented

### ✅ Initial Visibility Detection
- Properly detects when PlayScreen is initially visible (isVisible = true on app startup)
- Loads ad immediately in initState when screen is the default tab

### ✅ Visibility-Dependent Logic Maintained
- Preserves visibility checks to prevent multiple ads loading from different screens
- Only loads ads when screen is actually visible to users

### ✅ Duplicate Prevention
- `_isLoadingAd` flag prevents multiple simultaneous ad requests
- Checks existing ad state before creating new ads

### ✅ Error Handling & Recovery
- Comprehensive error logging with debugPrint
- Proper flag reset on failures allows for retry attempts
- UI remains stable even when ads fail to load

### ✅ Lifecycle Management
- Proper cleanup in dispose method
- Memory-efficient ad disposal when screen becomes invisible
- Mounted checks prevent setState on disposed widgets

### ✅ Debug & Testing Support
- Comprehensive debug logging for troubleshooting
- Helper methods for state inspection (_logAdState, _retryAdLoad)
- Loading indicators for better user experience

## Requirements Satisfied

- **Requirement 1.1**: ✅ Native ad displays immediately when PlayScreen opens for first time
- **Requirement 1.2**: ✅ Native ad loads properly after being hidden and becoming visible again
- **Requirement 1.4**: ✅ PlayScreen functions normally even if native ad fails to load
- **Requirement 1.5**: ✅ Ad loading state is properly managed to prevent memory leaks

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Checklist
1. **Fresh App Install**: Verify ad loads immediately on PlayScreen
2. **Tab Navigation**: Switch tabs and return to PlayScreen - ad should load
3. **Premium Users**: Verify no ads are shown for users with removeAds = true
4. **Network Issues**: Test with poor connectivity - verify graceful error handling
5. **Memory Usage**: Monitor memory usage when switching tabs frequently
6. **Error Recovery**: Test ad loading after network recovery

### Debug Logging
The implementation includes comprehensive debug logging that can be monitored during testing:
- `PlayScreen: initState called, isVisible: true/false`
- `PlayScreen: Loading ad on initState`
- `PlayScreen: Native ad loaded successfully`
- `PlayScreen: Native ad failed to load: [error]`
- `PlayScreen: Disposing native ad`

## Files Modified
- `lib/screens/play_screen.dart`: Enhanced ad loading logic and state management

## Impact
This implementation ensures that native ads load reliably on the PlayScreen, improving monetization while maintaining a smooth user experience. The enhanced error handling and state management prevent common issues like duplicate ad requests and memory leaks.
